    {"prompt": "If I get a Work based Visa, Can I Work for Another Company or Work on Something Else?",
        "completion": "Generally a non-immigrant (temporary) work based Visa only allows you to work in the profession and on the tasks that the Visa was issued for."},
    {"prompt": "What Happens if I Overstay My Visa or Work Without Authorization?",
        "completion": "You are only permitted to stay in the United States for the time designated on your I-94 form and any overstay can cause you problems."},
    {"prompt": "How Long Do I Have To Wait For My Visa or Green Card?",
        "completion": "The answer really depends on the Visa and where you are applying."},
    {"prompt": "If I Get A Green Card How Am I Taxed?",
        "completion": "If you get a green card you are considered a resident for tax purposes and you will be taxed on your WORLDWIDE income."},
    {"prompt": "If I Am Already in the United States Do I have To Leave And Reenter the U.S. if I Want To Change Visas?",
        "completion": "If you are in the U.S. and have a valid Visa, you will most likely be able to “change status” by filing the appropriate petitions."},
    {"prompt": "Can I Be Deported If I Get A Green Card?",
     "completion": "Yes."},
    {"prompt": "If I Get A Green Card Do I Have To Stay In The U.S.?",
        "completion": "Green cards are made available for people who want to live in the U.S. and the U.S. Government requires that you spend time here."},
    {"prompt": "Should I Pay an Immigration Lawyer Or Do The Work Myself?",
        "completion": "There are some immigration forms where you do not need a lawyer."},
    {"prompt": "How Do I Find A Good Immigration Lawyer?",
        "completion": "Make sure and ask your immigration lawyer whether or not he/she has handled your particular type of case before and ask how many they have handled."},
    {"prompt": "I want to file a petition for my sister/my brother, and I heard it takes a long time. Is this true?",
        "completion": "Yes, a sibling petition for permanent residency (green card) can take 10-12 years. If your sister or brother is interested in immigrating to the United States more immediately, she or he should explore student, work, or investment visa options."},
    {"prompt": "I have a green card; can I invite my parents to visit?",
        "completion": "Yes, you definitely can. Your parents need to show sufficient ties to their home country to convince USCIS that they intend only to come temporarily and that they will return to their country once their visa expires."},
    {"prompt": "My fiancé is overseas, and I want to bring her to the United States ASAP, should we try to apply for a tourist visa first because the processing time is shorter?",
        "completion": "As attorneys, we highly caution against applying for a tourist visa, if your fiancé is intending to live in the United States. In fact, USCIS assumes visa fraud if an applicant changes status while on a tourist visa. The timing of a possible adjustment of status is critical for arguing against the presumption of visa fraud. With a tourist visa, you are not supposed to have the intent to stay in the United States. Therefore, if USCIS finds out or feels as if your fiancé entered with the intent to stay in the U.S. and marry you, your fiancé will face major immigration issues."},
    {"prompt": "I filed for asylum. What is my status?",
     "completion": "You currently are an “asylum applicant,” which is not a legal status. However, as an asylum applicant, you have the right to stay and work in the United States until USCIS makes a decision regarding your application. The processing times varies depending on the asylum office involved."},
    {"prompt": "I am a DACA recipient, can I ever become a lawful permanent resident or become a citizen?",
        "completion": "There are options. It is not as straightforward as a regular case, but there are options. Depending on the application, there are ways to cure the unlawful presence. Best to speak with an immigration attorney to go over the details of your immigration history and discuss your options for the future."},
    {"prompt": "I had my immigration interview, and the Immigration Officer said that everything looked good, but then he said that they will follow-up with their decision. It has been weeks, and I have not heard back. Should I be worried?",
        "completion": "At this stage, it is a waiting game. You have to wait to see whether they request additional evidence via a Request For Evidence (RFE) or provide an approval notice, etc. If you do not hear anything within 90 days, call the USCIS customer service line and ask to speak with an immigration officer (one level up from the customer service representative). They can look in your file and make a service request about your case from the local office.\n\nYou can also make an InfoPass appointment with your local office to speak with someone in person."},
    {"prompt": "I obtained my conditional green card through marriage with my U.S. Citizen spouse. Things are not working out now, and I want to get a divorce. If we get divorced, will I lose my green card?",
        "completion": "Whether the relationship is not working out due to mutual disagreement or spousal abuse, rest assured, you do NOT have to stay in the relationship to maintain your green card and lawful permanent residence in the United States. The Petition to Remove Condition on Residence (Form I-751) provides a waiver of the joint filing requirement. If you are in this situation, it is important to keep reminding yourself about the deadline to file the I-751. If the petition is not filed on time, USCIS will terminate your legal residency status and there are deportation consequences."},
    {"prompt": "Can my spouse sponsor me for a green card if he is currently unemployed?",
        "completion": "He can petition for you, but he needs to have a joint sponsor. In other words, you need to find another person who will file an additional Affidavit of Support and who independently has sufficient income required by USCIS."},
    {"prompt": "I am on TPS right now, can I apply for a visa?",
        "completion": "As a TPS recipient, you are unable to adjust status, which means changing status while in the United States. You will have to apply for a visa abroad via consular processing."},
    {"prompt": "I have a green card application pending, and I need to travel back home. What do I need to do to travel and not risk my green card application?",
        "completion": "You need to apply for advance parole. Advance parole will allow you to travel abroad while your green card application is pending. Otherwise, USCIS may assume your green card application has been abandoned, which is a risk if you travel without advanced parole.\n\nHowever, if you are possibly inadmissible under other grounds (criminal record, immigration history, etc.), you might not be able to return to the United States. There are a lot of factors that determine whether a person is inadmissible or not. Thus, it is best to sit down with an attorney for a consultation to discuss the pro's and con's of leaving the country while an application is pending. It would be well worth the time and effort to do so and not risk your status or application."},
    {"prompt": "What is an H-1B working visa & who is eligible?",
     "completion": "A “specialty occupation” non-immigrant employment visa. It helps those with bachelor’s or advanced degrees, those working for the Department of Defense, or those working as a fashion model, work in the USA for certain periods of time.\n\nThe H-1B has several levels and criteria that qualify you in various ways. Some fall under the quota system, and others do not. It’s very important that you and your employer work very closely together to determine the requirements, and the timing, as there are deadlines for some H-1Bs, and for others, it may be better to apply at a different time of year when it’s not competing for attention with those satisfying the deadlines.\n\nYour H-1B visa may be for up to three years. Any renewals generally do not extend beyond six years. Some family members of the H-1B visa holder may seek H-4 nonimmigrant visas."},
    {"prompt": "Is there a limit to the number visas issued?",
        "completion": "Each year 65,000 visas are issued for bachelor degreed non-immigrants and 20,000 visas are for master degreed non-immigrants."},
    {"prompt": "What are the deadlines for applying?",
        "completion": "Start getting your paperwork ready in March. You can apply in early April is when you can first apply for the next fiscal year which starts October 1st. You cannot start work until October 1st."},
    {"prompt": "How long does the H-1B process take? I am looking for a job and I will need a visa, and this kind of visa seems like my most likely option, but I am concerned about the time frame. I need to start working soon.",
        "completion": "There are a few steps that must be completed before filing for an H-1B nonimmigrant visa. First, a prevailing wage must be submitted to the Department of Labor which may take 6-8 weeks. Next, a Labor Certification Application must be submitted again to the Department of Labor and this takes 1 week before it is approved. Once the documents are gathered and the petition submitted, it can take anywhere between 2-7 months depending on whether it is the first petition or a request for an extension. Thus the complete process may take between 4-9 months."},
    {"prompt": "I applied for an H-1B visa but I have not received approval yet. Does this likely mean that I have missed out this year? Is there any way for me to come to the US and start the job I was offered and apply again next year?",
        "completion": "Usually when you have missed the lottery for the H-1B visa, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services returns your application to the employer who petitioned for you. This is how you know that you were not selected. You cannot come to the United States and work unless you have a visa that allows you to work here. There are other visas such as the L-1 visa which allows managers or individuals with specialized knowledge to come from a company abroad to a company in the U.S. to work. The companies, however, must be related. An example is a parent company and its subsidiary."},
    {"prompt": "What if my job ends do I have to leave the country?",
        "completion": "If you are terminated for any reason you have a 60-day grace period to find a new job, then you have to complete the paperwork reflecting the change. If you quit, there is no grace period and your H-1B visa will come to an end."},
    {"prompt": "What if my employer wants to give me a promotion?",
     "completion": "The job has to remain the same job core. Your status cannot change from full-time to part-time and/or your payment cannot go down. You can get a raise without any issues. Basically, you have to continue to do the same core job in the same location. If not, your H-1B will need to be amended."},
    {
        "prompt": "WHAT IS DACA AND CAN I STILL GET IT?",
        "completion": "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an administrative relief from deportation, which protects eligible immigrant youth who came to the United States when they were children. DACA also provides its recipients with a work permit.\nDACA does not mean that someone has lawful “status” in the United States. Instead, USCIS defines deferred action as “an exercise of prosecutorial discretion…not to pursue the removal of an individual from the United States for a specific period.” DACA is not permanent, and it expires after two years. DACA recipients must renew their deferred action, along with their work permit, every two years.\nCurrently, USCIS is only accepting requests to renew a grant of deferred action under DACA. Unfortunately, at this time, USCIS is NOT accepting initial DACA requests from individuals who have never before been granted deferred action under DACA."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "WHAT CAN I DO IF MY IMMIGRATION CASE IS DENIED?",
        "completion": "If your immigration case is denied, do not fret—there might still be hope. In order to assess whether something can be done to remedy a denial, an immigration attorney must first determine what kind of immigration case you have, why the case was denied, when it was denied, whether there is new evidence you can now submit, and whether there are any new and changed circumstances.\nIf the United States and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied your immigration case, you may have the ability to appeal the negative decision. An appeal is essentially a request to have your negative decision reviewed. The denial notice should contain information about whether the decision may be appealed and where the appeal should be filed.\nIf you have a deportation order, you may also be able to remedy your immigration case by filing a motion to reopen or reconsider. "
    },
    {
        "prompt": "WHAT DO I DO IF ICE OFFICERS COME TO MY DOOR/HOUSE?",
        "completion": "If ICE officials show up at your door, remember that you have constitutional rights.\n\nDo not open your door!\nRemember to ask to see a warrant, and have ICE slip it under the door.\nIf ICE does not have a warrant, they cannot enter your home."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "WHAT HAPPENS IF ICE DOES HAVE A WARRANT?",
        "completion": "Make sure that a judge, not an immigration officer, signs the warrant and that it states your name.\nPlease also make sure that the warrant states specifically the place to be searched and the items to be seized.\nICE rarely obtains a warrant to arrest people in their homes or on the street, but sometimes they use administrative warrants—which are not sufficient!"

If you know you will be outside the USA, but don’t want to lose your LPR, apply for a re-entry permit, and consider applying at the nearest embassy or US consulate for a returning resident visa. Of course, this does not apply to members of the US armed services or civilian employees of the US government overseas on official business."},
    {"prompt": "I am a citizen of Bolivia and a permanent resident of the US and I want to sponsor my son to come to the US. He is not married. I am eligible for naturalization in about 5 months. Should I wait until I am a citizen to sponsor him, or will it make no difference?",
        "completion": "You should file a petition for him as soon as possible. This is because the petition can be upgraded once you become a United States citizen. Also, there is not a major difference in the priority dates for unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens and unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents. Thus, in either case, an individual would have to wait approximately 6-7 years before their priority dates become current under each category. If your son is under the age of 21, then he will qualify as a child of a permanent resident and have a short waiting period of approximately 3-4 months unless the numbers regress or slow down. Once you become a United States citizen then he will be considered an immediate relative and you do not have to worry about priority dates. He will be able to apply for an Immigrant Visa immediately."},
    {"prompt": "I am from Mexico but am a permanent resident of the US. I have a large family back home – brothers, sisters, parents, cousins, aunts, and uncles. I would love them to come here for a better life, but I want them to do it legally. Which relatives can I sponsor? I can naturalize next year. Will that make a difference? How long does the process take?",
        "completion": "As a lawful permanent resident you can petition for your parents, spouse, or children to come to the United States. However, they will not be able to immediately apply for an immigrant visa once the petition is approved because they have to wait until their visa numbers become available. The visa numbers are updated monthly on the visa bulletin by the Department of State. Once you naturalize, you will be able to petition for your parents, spouse, children, and even your siblings.\n\nYour parents can immediately apply for an Immigrant Visa once their petition is approved because they are considered immediate relatives. Your spouse will be considered an immediate relative as well as your children who are under 21. You will not be able to file a petition for your aunts, uncles, or cousins either as a lawful permanent resident or as a United States citizen. I would suggest filing for your parents, spouse, and/or children under 21 now because you can upgrade those petitions once you become a United States citizen. This will also save you some time. You should file a petition for your brothers and sisters once you become a United States citizen."},
    {"prompt": "My parents live in Honduras. I am a resident here and would like to know if I can bring my parents here and help them. What is the process and how long does it take?",
        "completion": "While your parents are free to come to the USA as tourists, you can only petition for permanent residence for your parents when you are a United States Citizen. When a citizen, you must petition for them with a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative. I would suggest filing a separate petition for each one of your parents as a safeguard if one of your parents passes away. Parents of U.S. citizens are considered immediate relatives so they don’t have to wait for a long time to get a visa number. The I-130 petition will take 3 to 6 months for adjudication. Once it is approved, your parents can come to the United States through consular processing on immigrant visas. They’ll receive their Green Cards once they arrive in America."},
    {"prompt": "My brother petitioned for me with an I-130 application and it was recently approved. I am now sending in an I-485. Back in 1980, when I was only 21 years old, I applied for an amnesty program. I was given a work permit. In 2006, however, I was denied an extension of the work permit because my lawyer lost the amnesty case in court. Is this going to affect my I-485 application?",
        "completion": "This will depend upon what the outcome of your case was in court. If you received an order of deportation, then that can affect your I-485 application. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services would not have jurisdiction to rule upon the case. Most likely you will have to request a motion to reopen your case because you are now able to adjust. Requesting a joint motion to reopen with the Department of Homeland Security is the best way to go. Also make sure that the petition filed by your brother was filed before April 30th, 2001. If not, then you will not be able to adjust in the United States and will have to pursue consular processing."},
    {"prompt": "I am a permanent resident and I filed an I-130 application for my daughter about 9 months ago. Since then she has married. Does this affect the application?",
        "completion": "Yes, your daughter’s marriage will remove her from the preference categories and she will no longer be able to apply for an Immigrant Visa until you become a United States citizen. Immigration law does not allow a lawful permanent resident to sponsor a married son or daughter."},
    {"prompt": "My mother, who was a US citizen, sponsored my sister to come to the US from Honduras. Sadly, my mother died two weeks ago. Does my sister need a new sponsor? What happens to her priority date?",
        "completion": "If your sister is not in the United States, then, unfortunately, her petition will be automatically revoked and she will lose her priority date. A petition remains valid only if the petitioner dies when the beneficiary is in the United States."},
    {"prompt": "If an F1 student with D/S status does unauthorized work what is the process of canceling his/her status? Can ISO cancel it without forwarding the case to an immigration judge? Does CBP have the same authority to cancel an F1 visa for work violations?",
        "completion": "Unauthorized employment automatically violates an F-1 status. When an ISO makes this determination (that a person has violated their status), the person is referred to ICE for removal proceedings and ICE makes that determination. You would need to contact CBP for the procedure for removal proceedings. Neither USCIS nor CBP cancels visas issued by DOS. ICE contact info: [email protected], or call 703-630-3400. Also, for the CBP web site, visit www.cbp.gov and go to travel, then international visitors, or call 877-227-1511. To contact the Dept. of State, visit www.state.gov."},
    {"prompt": "For F-1 students with approved OPT who intend to engage in self-employment, does the time that the student is setting up the business (forming a legal entity, getting a business license, taking professional exams, etc.) count as employment, or would NSC view these preparatory activities as unemployment and therefore count against the 90-day maximum unemployment period for maintaining F-1 status?",
     "completion": "The SEVIS Policy Manual says that a student on OPT may be self-employed and must be able to prove that he or she has the proper business licenses and is actively engaged in a business related to the student’s degree program. In response to a follow-up question about the 90-day period, NSC responded that all the cases it has seen involved situations where the student already had the business set-up."},
    {"prompt": "I came to the US on a visitor visa but I don’t want to go back to Colombia. When I came I had every intention of leaving, but now with a month left on my visa the thought of going back, there is filling me with dread. What are my options? I have a college degree and I speak fluent Spanish.",
        "completion": "You have a few options. You can enroll into a school and obtain an F-1 student nonimmigrant visa. If you believe you require more time to enroll in school, then you can request an extension of your B-2 visitor status with USCIS. Another option is if a company is willing to petition for you for an H-1B nonimmigrant visa; however, you have to maintain status until your change of status is granted."},
    {"prompt": "I own a business here in the US. It is very successful. I pay all my taxes and I have hired a lot of workers. My problem is that I am here illegally. I have been here 9 years but I have no relatives who are US citizens and I have worked so hard to build my business and I am a respected leader in my community. I am very worried that my status will be discovered and I could lose everything I have worked for. Is there anything proactive I can do? If I have to leave I would have no choice but to close the business and then lots of people would suffer.",
        "completion": "There are no proactive steps you can take to gain status in the United States. There is a possibility of applying for asylum, however, you must explain why you did not file for asylum within one year of your last entry which is difficult to overcome. If you do get picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then you can explain the benefits you have provided to your community and to others and they have discretion whether to institute proceedings against you."},
    {"prompt": "Please describe the process Nebraska undertakes when an I-824 is approved and the case is to be sent to the National Visa Center (“NVC”) for following-to-join immigrant processing. What customer service options are available when the significant time has passed between the I-824 approval and when the beneficiary is notified by the NVC that the case is ready for further processing? This file-transfer process causes considerable hardship to families who are unable to obtain redress from USCIS (which just confirms that the I-824 was approved) and the NVC (which just claims it doesn’t have the case).",
     "completion": "When NSC approves a petition, it sends copies of relevant documents to the NVC for further processing. If petitioners are experiencing delays in hearing from NVC, they can contact NVC at [email protected] or (603) 334-0700. NSC is working with NVC to improve processes, which it reiterated in response to a follow-up question about delays."},
    {"prompt": "If a relative of F1 student files and I-130 for the F, then, what are the risks of traveling for F1 because F1 is not a dual intent visa?",

    {"prompt": "What is the risk of trying to cross the border in Mexico without my passport? I have been restricted from using my passport because I am behind on my child support. Could I use my certificate of citizenship and my ID?",
     "completion": "A U.S. Passport is required to enter the United States by either land, air, or sea."},
    {"prompt": "I am waiting for my Green Card application to be processed and it has already taken more than a year. I need to travel for my work and I am worried that I will lose my job if I cannot go on this trip. I am also afraid to tell my boss that my Green Card has not been granted yet. Can I request permission to leave and come back without abandoning the application? Do I have to tell my boss (he is not my sponsor)?",
     "completion": "You can apply for advanced parole which allows you to leave the United States and reenter while your application for a permanent resident is pending with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. You do not have to notify your boss that you are applying for Advanced Parole."},
    {"prompt": "Q: I have a 12-year-old son. He crossed the border with me when he was 6 years old. Is he going to be able to apply for DACA in the future?",
        "completion": "A: If your son entered the United States on or before June 15th, 2007, then he will be eligible for DACA once he turns 15 and meets the other DACA requirements."},
    {"prompt": "Three years ago my family came to the US from the Dominican Republic with a tourist visa. We overstayed because of my son’s medical condition and because we found him treatment here with a wonderful neurologist. He was born with cerebral injuries and is much better under treatment here than I could ever have afforded in my country. What can my husband and I do to remain here?",
        "completion": "You may be able to request Humanitarian Parole, however, this is usually done before seeking entry into the United States. If you are discovered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be unlawfully present in the United States, you can explain to the officers your situation. ICE has discretion in deciding to institute proceedings or not."},
    {"prompt": "I am a permanent resident. Do I have to wait to become a citizen to legally change my name? My father gave me a boy’s name that I don’t like and I was told that I could change my name.",
        "completion": "You do not have to wait until you are a citizen to change your name. You can change your name in accordance with the procedures set forth in your state."},
    {"prompt": "I came to the US as a student and I paid a girl to marry me so I could get a Green Card. I am unable to locate her and I need to file the I-751. I am worried that USCIS will discover my fraud. Can I still file the I-751 without her?",
        "completion": "We do not recommend filing an application which is fraudulent."},
    {"prompt": "Question: What happens if someone did not enter the US legally but now is working for a company that wants to sponsor you?",
        "completion": "Answer: If a person did not enter legally and is now working for a company who wants to sponsor him, then that individual will not be able to adjust status to permanent resident in the United States. Entering without inspection is inadmissibility to getting a green card."},
    {"prompt": "Question: I came to the US on a visitor visa but I don’t want to go back to Colombia.

    {"prompt": "Question: I just found out that my boss has no documents and he was arrested by ICE. What will happen to his restaurant if he is deported?",
        "completion": "Answer: This will depend on whether or not your boss can maintain the business in the United States during his absence."},
    {"prompt": "Question: I need to have my visa renewed. Do I have to go back to my home country, Peru, or can I go to the US consulate in Canada, which is much closer?",
        "completion": "Answer: You can go to Canada to get your visa renewed, however, please keep in mind that you may need a visa issued by Canada to enter the country. Also keep in mind that many other individuals seek to renew their visa at the U.S. Consulate in Canada."},
    {"prompt": "Question: I have no documents here in the US, but I really want to go to college and study nursing. I have no social security so I can’t sign up for the classes. I also don’t qualify for DACA. Is there any way that I can get a visa to be a student even though I came illegally?",
        "completion": "Answer: No, you will not be approved for a student visa. However, you are not required to have a visa to attend college. Some schools may require a social security number, but you can apply for a tax I.D. number and use that instead."},
    {"prompt": "Question: Two months ago I filed my I-751 application after being married for two years. Last week my husband asked me for a divorce, but said he would wait until after my green card is approved. Can I get divorced while the application is pending and still get my green card, or should I take my husband up on his offer to wait?",
        "completion": "Answer: As long as you are prepared to prove that your marriage was bona-fide at the time, you can still have conditions removed from your green card even if you are divorced. Since your I-751 is currently pending, it may be advisable to wait until it is approved."},

    {"prompt": "What is a green card?",
        "completion": "A “green card,” issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), provides proof of lawful permanent resident status, with authorization to live and work anywhere in the United States.

        "completion": "A conditional green card is valid for only 2 years, and the designation “CR1” on the physical card stands for “conditional resident.” A conditional green card holder must file Form I-751 to “remove the conditions” and obtain a permanent green card. In most cases, a conditional green card is issued to a spouse who has been married for less than 2 years at the time their green card was first approved."},
    {"prompt": "Why would a green card application be denied?",
        "completion": "A green card application may be denied by the U.S. government for several reasons, including but not limited to mistakes on the required forms, missing documents, insufficient financial resources, or failure to demonstrate eligibility.

        "completion": "The Visa Bulletin, issued every month by the U.S. Department of State, shows which green card applications can move forward, based on when the I-130 petition that starts the green card process was originally filed. The visa bulletin exists because Congress caps the number of green cards that can be issued each year in certain categories, which has created several backlogs."},
    {"prompt": "What is a biometric screening?",
        "completion": "During a biometric screening, a government representative records an individual’s fingerprints and takes their photos and signature, in order to check government records for any serious criminal history or relevant prior immigration violations.
