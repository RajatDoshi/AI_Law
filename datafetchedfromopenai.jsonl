{"prompt": "If I get a Work based Visa, Can I Work for Another Company or Work on Something Else?", "completion": "Generally a non-immigrant (temporary) work based Visa only allows you to work in the profession and on the tasks that the Visa was issued for."}
{"prompt": "What Happens if I Overstay My Visa or Work Without Authorization?", "completion": "You are only permitted to stay in the United States for the time designated on your I-94 form and any overstay can cause you problems."}
{"prompt": "How Long Do I Have To Wait For My Visa or Green Card?", "completion": "The answer really depends on the Visa and where you are applying."}
{"prompt": "If I Get A Green Card How Am I Taxed?", "completion": "If you get a green card you are considered a resident for tax purposes and you will be taxed on your WORLDWIDE income."}
{"prompt": "If I Am Already in the United States Do I have To Leave And Reenter the U.S. if I Want To Change Visas?", "completion": "If you are in the U.S. and have a valid Visa, you will most likely be able to \u201cchange status\u201d by filing the appropriate petitions."}
{"prompt": "Can I Be Deported If I Get A Green Card?", "completion": "Yes."}
{"prompt": "If I Get A Green Card Do I Have To Stay In The U.S.?", "completion": "Green cards are made available for people who want to live in the U.S. and the U.S. Government requires that you spend time here."}
{"prompt": "Should I Pay an Immigration Lawyer Or Do The Work Myself?", "completion": "There are some immigration forms where you do not need a lawyer."}
{"prompt": "How Do I Find A Good Immigration Lawyer?", "completion": "Make sure and ask your immigration lawyer whether or not he/she has handled your particular type of case before and ask how many they have handled."}
{"prompt": "I want to file a petition for my sister/my brother, and I heard it takes a long time. Is this true?", "completion": "Yes, a sibling petition for permanent residency (green card) can take 10-12 years. If your sister or brother is interested in immigrating to the United States more immediately, she or he should explore student, work, or investment visa options."}
{"prompt": "I have a green card; can I invite my parents to visit?", "completion": "Yes, you definitely can. Your parents need to show sufficient ties to their home country to convince USCIS that they intend only to come temporarily and that they will return to their country once their visa expires."}
{"prompt": "My fianc\u00e9 is overseas, and I want to bring her to the United States ASAP, should we try to apply for a tourist visa first because the processing time is shorter?", "completion": "As attorneys, we highly caution against applying for a tourist visa, if your fianc\u00e9 is intending to live in the United States. In fact, USCIS assumes visa fraud if an applicant changes status while on a tourist visa. The timing of a possible adjustment of status is critical for arguing against the presumption of visa fraud. With a tourist visa, you are not supposed to have the intent to stay in the United States. Therefore, if USCIS finds out or feels as if your fianc\u00e9 entered with the intent to stay in the U.S. and marry you, your fianc\u00e9 will face major immigration issues."}
{"prompt": "I filed for asylum. What is my status?", "completion": "You currently are an \u201casylum applicant,\u201d which is not a legal status. However, as an asylum applicant, you have the right to stay and work in the United States until USCIS makes a decision regarding your application. The processing times varies depending on the asylum office involved."}
{"prompt": "I am a DACA recipient, can I ever become a lawful permanent resident or become a citizen?", "completion": "There are options. It is not as straightforward as a regular case, but there are options. Depending on the application, there are ways to cure the unlawful presence. Best to speak with an immigration attorney to go over the details of your immigration history and discuss your options for the future."}
{"prompt": "I had my immigration interview, and the Immigration Officer said that everything looked good, but then he said that they will follow-up with their decision. It has been weeks, and I have not heard back. Should I be worried?", "completion": "At this stage, it is a waiting game. You have to wait to see whether they request additional evidence via a Request For Evidence (RFE) or provide an approval notice, etc. If you do not hear anything within 90 days, call the USCIS customer service line and ask to speak with an immigration officer (one level up from the customer service representative). They can look in your file and make a service request about your case from the local office.\n\nYou can also make an InfoPass appointment with your local office to speak with someone in person."}
{"prompt": "I obtained my conditional green card through marriage with my U.S. Citizen spouse. Things are not working out now, and I want to get a divorce. If we get divorced, will I lose my green card?", "completion": "Whether the relationship is not working out due to mutual disagreement or spousal abuse, rest assured, you do NOT have to stay in the relationship to maintain your green card and lawful permanent residence in the United States. The Petition to Remove Condition on Residence (Form I-751) provides a waiver of the joint filing requirement. If you are in this situation, it is important to keep reminding yourself about the deadline to file the I-751. If the petition is not filed on time, USCIS will terminate your legal residency status and there are deportation consequences."}
{"prompt": "Can my spouse sponsor me for a green card if he is currently unemployed?", "completion": "He can petition for you, but he needs to have a joint sponsor. In other words, you need to find another person who will file an additional Affidavit of Support and who independently has sufficient income required by USCIS."}
{"prompt": "I am on TPS right now, can I apply for a visa?", "completion": "As a TPS recipient, you are unable to adjust status, which means changing status while in the United States. You will have to apply for a visa abroad via consular processing."}
{"prompt": "I have a green card application pending, and I need to travel back home. What do I need to do to travel and not risk my green card application?", "completion": "You need to apply for advance parole. Advance parole will allow you to travel abroad while your green card application is pending. Otherwise, USCIS may assume your green card application has been abandoned, which is a risk if you travel without advanced parole.\n\nHowever, if you are possibly inadmissible under other grounds (criminal record, immigration history, etc.), you might not be able to return to the United States. There are a lot of factors that determine whether a person is inadmissible or not. Thus, it is best to sit down with an attorney for a consultation to discuss the pro's and con's of leaving the country while an application is pending. It would be well worth the time and effort to do so and not risk your status or application."}
{"prompt": "What is an H-1B working visa & who is eligible?", "completion": "A \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d non-immigrant employment visa. It helps those with bachelor\u2019s or advanced degrees, those working for the Department of Defense, or those working as a fashion model, work in the USA for certain periods of time.\n\nThe H-1B has several levels and criteria that qualify you in various ways. Some fall under the quota system, and others do not. It\u2019s very important that you and your employer work very closely together to determine the requirements, and the timing, as there are deadlines for some H-1Bs, and for others, it may be better to apply at a different time of year when it\u2019s not competing for attention with those satisfying the deadlines.\n\nYour H-1B visa may be for up to three years. Any renewals generally do not extend beyond six years. Some family members of the H-1B visa holder may seek H-4 nonimmigrant visas."}
{"prompt": "Is there a limit to the number visas issued?", "completion": "Each year 65,000 visas are issued for bachelor degreed non-immigrants and 20,000 visas are for master degreed non-immigrants."}
{"prompt": "What are the deadlines for applying?", "completion": "Start getting your paperwork ready in March. You can apply in early April is when you can first apply for the next fiscal year which starts October 1st. You cannot start work until October 1st."}
{"prompt": "How long does the H-1B process take? I am looking for a job and I will need a visa, and this kind of visa seems like my most likely option, but I am concerned about the time frame. I need to start working soon.", "completion": "There are a few steps that must be completed before filing for an H-1B nonimmigrant visa. First, a prevailing wage must be submitted to the Department of Labor which may take 6-8 weeks. Next, a Labor Certification Application must be submitted again to the Department of Labor and this takes 1 week before it is approved. Once the documents are gathered and the petition submitted, it can take anywhere between 2-7 months depending on whether it is the first petition or a request for an extension. Thus the complete process may take between 4-9 months."}
{"prompt": "I applied for an H-1B visa but I have not received approval yet. Does this likely mean that I have missed out this year? Is there any way for me to come to the US and start the job I was offered and apply again next year?", "completion": "Usually when you have missed the lottery for the H-1B visa, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services returns your application to the employer who petitioned for you. This is how you know that you were not selected. You cannot come to the United States and work unless you have a visa that allows you to work here. There are other visas such as the L-1 visa which allows managers or individuals with specialized knowledge to come from a company abroad to a company in the U.S. to work. The companies, however, must be related. An example is a parent company and its subsidiary."}
{"prompt": "What if my job ends do I have to leave the country?", "completion": "If you are terminated for any reason you have a 60-day grace period to find a new job, then you have to complete the paperwork reflecting the change. If you quit, there is no grace period and your H-1B visa will come to an end."}
{"prompt": "What if my employer wants to give me a promotion?", "completion": "The job has to remain the same job core. Your status cannot change from full-time to part-time and/or your payment cannot go down. You can get a raise without any issues. Basically, you have to continue to do the same core job in the same location. If not, your H-1B will need to be amended."}
{"prompt": "WHAT IS DACA AND CAN I STILL GET IT?", "completion": "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an administrative relief from deportation, which protects eligible immigrant youth who came to the United States when they were children. DACA also provides its recipients with a work permit.\nDACA does not mean that someone has lawful \u201cstatus\u201d in the United States. Instead, USCIS defines deferred action as \u201can exercise of prosecutorial discretion\u2026not to pursue the removal of an individual from the United States for a specific period.\u201d DACA is not permanent, and it expires after two years. DACA recipients must renew their deferred action, along with their work permit, every two years.\nCurrently, USCIS is only accepting requests to renew a grant of deferred action under DACA. Unfortunately, at this time, USCIS is NOT accepting initial DACA requests from individuals who have never before been granted deferred action under DACA."}
{"prompt": "WHAT CAN I DO IF MY IMMIGRATION CASE IS DENIED?", "completion": "If your immigration case is denied, do not fret\u2014there might still be hope. In order to assess whether something can be done to remedy a denial, an immigration attorney must first determine what kind of immigration case you have, why the case was denied, when it was denied, whether there is new evidence you can now submit, and whether there are any new and changed circumstances.\nIf the United States and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied your immigration case, you may have the ability to appeal the negative decision. An appeal is essentially a request to have your negative decision reviewed. The denial notice should contain information about whether the decision may be appealed and where the appeal should be filed.\nIf you have a deportation order, you may also be able to remedy your immigration case by filing a motion to reopen or reconsider. "}
{"prompt": "WHAT DO I DO IF ICE OFFICERS COME TO MY DOOR/HOUSE?", "completion": "If ICE officials show up at your door, remember that you have constitutional rights.\n\nDo not open your door!\nRemember to ask to see a warrant, and have ICE slip it under the door.\nIf ICE does not have a warrant, they cannot enter your home."}
{"prompt": "WHAT HAPPENS IF ICE DOES HAVE A WARRANT?", "completion": "Make sure that a judge, not an immigration officer, signs the warrant and that it states your name.\nPlease also make sure that the warrant states specifically the place to be searched and the items to be seized.\nICE rarely obtains a warrant to arrest people in their homes or on the street, but sometimes they use administrative warrants\u2014which are not sufficient!"}

{"prompt": "How long does the H-1B process take? I am looking for a job and I will need a visa, and this kind of visa seems like my most likely option, but I am concerned about the timeframe. I need to start working soon.", "completion": "There are a few steps that must be completed before filing for an H-1B nonimmigrant visa. First, a prevailing wage must be submitted to the Department of Labor which may take 6-8 weeks. Next a Labor Certification Application must be submitted again to the Department of Labor and this takes 1 week before it is approved. Once the documents are gathered and the petition submitted, it can take anywhere between 2-7 months depending on whether it is the first petition or a request for an extension. Thus the complete process may take between 4-9 months."}
{"prompt": "I was one of the lucky people to get one of the H-1B visas and I was due to start working in October. I was just told by my employer that they are downsizing and won\u2019t be hiring me. Is there anything I can do to protect the visa? Can I transfer it to another job if I can find one?", "completion": "Yes, you can transfer to another job if you can find one. Your new employer will have to file a new H-1B petition for you."}
{"prompt": "Can you travel internationally while an LPR?", "completion": "You must have your passport issued by the country where you are a citizen, and to return to the USA, you must have your Green Card. It\u2019s also helpful to have other documents such as your US driver\u2019s license. You can also lose your permanent residency by staying outside the US for a long time, moving temporarily or permanently, calling yourself a non-immigrant on your taxes, or failure to file income taxes while living outside the United States. If you know you will be outside the USA, but don\u2019t want to lose your LPR, apply for a re-entry permit, and consider applying at the nearest embassy or US consulate for a returning resident visa. Of course, this does not apply to members of the US armed services or civilian employees of the US government overseas on official business."}
{"prompt": "I am a citizen of Bolivia and a permanent resident of the US and I want to sponsor my son to come to the US. He is not married. I am eligible for naturalization in about 5 months. Should I wait until I am a citizen to sponsor him, or will it make no difference?", "completion": "You should file a petition for him as soon as possible. This is because the petition can be upgraded once you become a United States citizen. Also, there is not a major difference in the priority dates for unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens and unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents. Thus, in either case, an individual would have to wait approximately 6-7 years before their priority dates become current under each category. If your son is under the age of 21, then he will qualify as a child of a permanent resident and have a short waiting period of approximately 3-4 months unless the numbers regress or slow down. Once you become a United States citizen then he will be considered an immediate relative and you do not have to worry about priority dates. He will be able to apply for an Immigrant Visa immediately."}
{"prompt": "I am from Mexico but am a permanent resident of the US. I have a large family back home \u2013 brothers, sisters, parents, cousins, aunts, and uncles. I would love them to come here for a better life, but I want them to do it legally. Which relatives can I sponsor? I can naturalize next year. Will that make a difference? How long does the process take?", "completion": "As a lawful permanent resident you can petition for your parents, spouse, or children to come to the United States. However, they will not be able to immediately apply for an immigrant visa once the petition is approved because they have to wait until their visa numbers become available. The visa numbers are updated monthly on the visa bulletin by the Department of State. Once you naturalize, you will be able to petition for your parents, spouse, children, and even your siblings.\n\nYour parents can immediately apply for an Immigrant Visa once their petition is approved because they are considered immediate relatives. Your spouse will be considered an immediate relative as well as your children who are under 21. You will not be able to file a petition for your aunts, uncles, or cousins either as a lawful permanent resident or as a United States citizen. I would suggest filing for your parents, spouse, and/or children under 21 now because you can upgrade those petitions once you become a United States citizen. This will also save you some time. You should file a petition for your brothers and sisters once you become a United States citizen."}
{"prompt": "My parents live in Honduras. I am a resident here and would like to know if I can bring my parents here and help them. What is the process and how long does it take?", "completion": "While your parents are free to come to the USA as tourists, you can only petition for permanent residence for your parents when you are a United States Citizen. When a citizen, you must petition for them with a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative. I would suggest filing a separate petition for each one of your parents as a safeguard if one of your parents passes away. Parents of U.S. citizens are considered immediate relatives so they don\u2019t have to wait for a long time to get a visa number. The I-130 petition will take 3 to 6 months for adjudication. Once it is approved, your parents can come to the United States through consular processing on immigrant visas. They\u2019ll receive their Green Cards once they arrive in America."}
{"prompt": "My brother petitioned for me with an I-130 application and it was recently approved. I am now sending in an I-485. Back in 1980, when I was only 21 years old, I applied for an amnesty program. I was given a work permit. In 2006, however, I was denied an extension of the work permit because my lawyer lost the amnesty case in court. Is this going to affect my I-485 application?", "completion": "This will depend upon what the outcome of your case was in court. If you received an order of deportation, then that can affect your I-485 application. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services would not have jurisdiction to rule upon the case. Most likely you will have to request a motion to reopen your case because you are now able to adjust. Requesting a joint motion to reopen with the Department of Homeland Security is the best way to go. Also make sure that the petition filed by your brother was filed before April 30th, 2001. If not, then you will not be able to adjust in the United States and will have to pursue consular processing."}
{"prompt": "I am a permanent resident and I filed an I-130 application for my daughter about 9 months ago. Since then she has married. Does this affect the application?", "completion": "Yes, your daughter\u2019s marriage will remove her from the preference categories and she will no longer be able to apply for an Immigrant Visa until you become a United States citizen. Immigration law does not allow a lawful permanent resident to sponsor a married son or daughter."}
{"prompt": "My mother, who was a US citizen, sponsored my sister to come to the US from Honduras. Sadly, my mother died two weeks ago. Does my sister need a new sponsor?

When an ISO makes this determination (that a person has violated their status), the person is referred to ICE for removal proceedings and ICE makes that determination. You would need to contact CBP for the procedure for removal proceedings. Neither USCIS nor CBP cancels visas issued by DOS. ICE contact info: [email protected], or call 703-630-3400.

In response to a follow-up question about the 90-day period, NSC responded that all the cases it has seen involved situations where the student already had the business set-up."}

I have a college degree and I speak fluent Spanish.", "completion": "You have a few options. You can enroll into a school and obtain an F-1 student nonimmigrant visa. If you believe you require more time to enroll in school, then you can request an extension of your B-2 visitor status with USCIS. Another option is if a company is willing to petition for you for an H-1B nonimmigrant visa; however, you have to maintain status until your change of status is granted."}

I am very worried that my status will be discovered and I could lose everything I have worked for. Is there anything proactive I can do? If I have to leave I would have no choice but to close the business and then lots of people would suffer.", "completion": "There are no proactive steps you can take to gain status in the United States. There is a possibility of applying for asylum, however, you must explain why you did not file for asylum within one year of your last entry which is difficult to overcome. If you do get picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then you can explain the benefits you have provided to your community and to others and they have discretion whether to institute proceedings against you."}

This file-transfer process causes considerable hardship to families who are unable to obtain redress from USCIS (which just confirms that the I-824 was approved) and the NVC (which just claims it doesn\u2019t have the case).", "completion": "When NSC approves a petition, it sends copies of relevant documents to the NVC for further processing. If petitioners are experiencing delays in hearing from NVC, they can contact NVC at [email protected] or (603) 334-0700.

{"prompt": "Three years ago my family came to the US from the Dominican Republic with a tourist visa. We overstayed because of my son\u2019s medical condition and because we found him treatment here with a wonderful neurologist. He was born with cerebral injuries and is much better under treatment here than I could ever have afforded in my country. What can my husband and I do to remain here?", "completion": "You may be able to request Humanitarian Parole, however, this is usually done before seeking entry into the United States. If you are discovered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be unlawfully present in the United States, you can explain to the officers your situation. ICE has discretion in deciding to institute proceedings or not."}

{"prompt": "Question: What happens if someone did not enter the US legally but now is working for a company that wants to sponsor you?", "completion": "Answer: If a person did not enter legally and is now working for a company who wants to sponsor him, then that individual will not be able to adjust status to permanent resident in the United States.
